                                citizen of the European Union. As a citizen of the European Union, you are entitled to a
                                full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins.</p>

                                Note: This 14-day period begins when the training course starts, i.e. the day you have
                                paid for the subscription fees, and not on the day you first started with your training.
